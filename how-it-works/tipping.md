# Tipping
Tipping is an exciting new feature on GibWork that empowers open-source maintainers to reward the valuable efforts of contributors. As a open-source maintainer, you have the opportunity to reward your community outside of bounties and other traditional methods.

## Why is tipping important?

### Recognition
Tipping serves as a meaningful way to acknowledge the dedication and contributions of individuals within the open-source community. It fosters a culture of recognition where contributors feel valued and appreciated for their efforts.

### Community Building
By enabling tipping, GibWork cultivates a sense of community among contributors. It promotes a positive environment where individuals feel connected to the project and motivated to actively participate and collaborate.

### Retention
The ability to tip contributors encourages their continued engagement with the project. It enhances retention by recognizing and rewarding their efforts, thereby fostering long-term stability and growth.

### Motivation
Tipping acts as a powerful motivator for open-source contributors, especially those who volunteer their time and skills without expecting financial compensation. It serves as a token of encouragement and appreciation, inspiring contributors to sustain their passion and commitment.


## Tipping Scenarios

1. Tipping Open Source Contributors: Acknowledge the contributions of open-source contributors who enhance the project's development, documentation, or community engagement.

2. Tipping Bug Reporters via GitHub Issues: Reward users who contribute by reporting bugs or issues via GitHub, thereby improving the project's quality and reliability.

3. Tipping Pull Request Openers: Show appreciation to contributors who submit pull requests with new features, enhancements, or bug fixes, driving the evolution and maintenance of the project.

## How to Tip contributors using ` @gibworkbot ` as an open source maintainer?

Tipping on GibWork is a straightforward process accessible directly from the project dashboard. Here's a simple guide to tipping:

1. **Locate the Issue or PR**: Identify the issue raised by the contributor, or find the Pull Request Opened by the contributor.
   
2. **Select the Contributor**: Identify the individual you wish to tip, recognizing their contributions to the project, whether through code, documentation, or community support.

3. **Specify the Amount**: Determine the amount you'd like to tip, considering the significance of the contribution and your budgetary constraints.

### Syntax for Tipping

To tip a contributor, utilize the following syntax:


` @gibworkbot tip [amount in USDC] @username_of_contributor `  

For instance, to tip 10 USDC to a contributor with the username @exampleuser:

` @gibworkbot tip 10 @exampleuser `

Note: Currently the ` @gibworkbot ` supports only USDC token. We are working hard to ensure rewards in other tokens shortly.

### How It Works?

After initiating the tipping process, the ` @gibworkbot ` will show a message like this:

` @gibworkbot ` will guide you through the following steps:


1. Click on the ` **Gibtips link** ` to access the tipping interface and add the desired amount to the escrow. The escrow typically utilizes a non-custodial wallet like Solfare, phantom and Backpack for secure transactions.
